Summary

We want to have a shell script that can use the "blueutil" command-line utility to automatically
connect to bluetooth keyboards, mouse, and other devices.

The "blueutil.txt" file contains a summary of how to use the "blueutil" utility

Details

* This should be a shell script
* The list of target devices (to connect to) should be stored in an array so that it can be
modified later by the user to add additional devices
* By default, the script should connect to keyboard and mouse

When invoked, the script should

* make a list of all paired devices
* If the target device(s) is not connected, it should attempt to connect to it
* Print out the final status of the connection

Other items

* always invoke "blueutil" so that the output format is in JSON
* check that all dependencies (such as blueutil and jq) are installed and available on the path
* The script should also support a "debug" option. When invoked with the debug option, 
script should also print the list of all paired devices along with their connection status
* The script should use colored out (RED/GREEN) and emojis (check mark etc) appropriately


Testing

* Run the blueutil tool directly to list all the paired devices
* use the blueutil took directly to disconnect the keyboard and/or mouse
* run the script to connect to the devices
* Then run the blueutil tool directly to confirm that both keyboard and mouse are connected
