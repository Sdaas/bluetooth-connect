Due to possible problems, blueutil will refuse to run as root user (see https://github.com/toy/blueutil/issues/41).
Use environment variable BLUEUTIL_ALLOW_ROOT=1 to override (sudo BLUEUTIL_ALLOW_ROOT=1 blueutil …).

Environment variables:
  BLUEUTIL_USE_SYSTEM_PROFILER=1  EXPERIMENTAL: use system_profiler instead of IOBluetoothDevice API for paired device queries

  64 Wrong usage like missing or unexpected arguments, wrong parameters
  69 Bluetooth or interface not available
  70 Internal error
  71 System error like shortage of memory
